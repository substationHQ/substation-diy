          <h3>First things first</h3>
          <p>
            Substation is free software. That means independence and control. You can make your community truly 
            yours and customize things however you like. But you'll have to edit a config file and some html. There
            is set-up. That might sound intimidating, but you can handle it.

            Your potential members first interact with the substation sign-up embed.
            This can live on your site or on a simple page hosted by substation — or both. There's a dashboard you can use 
            to email all members or export a CSV. It's all built on a simple API that handles email verification,
            mailing campaigns, and recurring paments.
          </p><p>
            You can see the sign-up embed in the demo above. Here are a few pictures of the dashboard and email.

          <h3>So how does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            Substation is just a few parts stitched together with a library we built called 
            <a href="https://lodge.substation.dev/">Lodge</a>. For now you'll need accounts with <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a>
            (payments) and <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/" taget="_blank">Mailgun</a> (bulk email) to get it all 
            running. Neither will cost you anything but a little time to set up.
          </p><p>
            Lodge handles the embed, which can open a full-screen checkout overlay of whatever page it lives on, 
            and it's as easy to embed as a YouTube video:
          </p>
          
          <code class="embed">
            &lt;!-- Substation embed code --&gt;
            <br />
            &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/substationhq/lodge@0.9.1/dist/lodge.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
            &lt;embed class="lodge" src="{{substationURL}}embed"&gt;<br />
          </code>

          <p>
            So here's the weird thing. There's no database. We wanted to make substation as easy to use as possible,
            so we designed around what we could do with the Braintree API and email authentication. So all customer
            information is stored safely with the payment provider, and user authentication happens pretty much like 
            every other site resets a password — except without a password. Just push a button in your inbox to 
            login. 
          </p><p> 
            This means all of substation is configured and customized with a single <code>.env</code> file 
            and a few markup/css files for customization — and more importantly it makes custom software a lot less
            intimidating. Databases can cut you.

            What's next?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Substation is a work in progress. Right now we're exploring more payment options and services for Lodge. Up next the idea is to move substation
            towards more of a serverless architecture, but carefully so it can work on services like Glitch and Vercel 
            side by side. 
          </p><p>
            We're going to keep making substation easier and better, because we think it's important for people to have
            more ways to connect and support each other directly.
